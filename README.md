### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Thanks for visiting! I use GitHub mainly to host my personal projects, my blog and to sometimes contribute to open source projects.

Previously, I pushed code for basics of Machine Learning and some BI projects. Currently, I am exploring ways to optimally run Spark code. I also intend to learn Scala, since I primarily run PySpark.
